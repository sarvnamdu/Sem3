<h3>OOPs<h/3> 

1. Solve problems by using sequential search, binary search, and quadratic sorting algorithms
(selection, insertion)
2. Develop stack and queue data structures using classes and objects.
3. Develop a java application with an Employee class with Emp_name, Emp_id, Address, Mail_id,
Mobile_no as members. Inherit the classes, Programmer, Assistant Professor,
Associate Professor and Professor from employee class. Add Basic Pay (BP) as the member
of all the inherited classes with 97% of BP as DA, 10 % of BP as HRA, 12% of
BP as PF, 0.1% of BP for staff club funds. Generate pay slips for the employees with their gross
and net salary.
4. Write a Java Program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains two integers and
an empty method named printArea(). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and
Circle such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes
contains only the method printArea( ) that prints the area of the given shape.
5. Solve the above problem using an interface.
6. Implement exception handling and creation of user defined exceptions.
7. Write a java program that implements a multi-threaded application that has three threads. First
thread generates a random integer every 1 second and if the value is even, the second thread
computes the square of the number and prints. If the value is odd, the third thread will print the
value of the cube of the number.
8. Write a program to perform file operations.
9. Develop applications to demonstrate the features of generics classes.
10. Develop applications using JavaFX controls, layouts and menus.
11. Develop a mini project for any application using Java concepts.


<h3>Data Science</h3>

1. Download, install and explore the features of NumPy, SciPy, Jupyter, Statsmodels and Pandas
packages.
2. Working with Numpy arrays
3. Working with Pandas data frames
4. Reading data from text files, Excel and the web and exploring various commands for doing
descriptive analytics on the Iris data set.
5. Use the diabetes data set from UCI and Pima Indians Diabetes data set for performing the
following:
a. Univariate analysis: Frequency, Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation,
Skewness and Kurtosis.
b. Bivariate analysis: Linear and logistic regression modeling
c. Multiple Regression analysis
d. Also compare the results of the above analysis for the two data sets.
6. Apply and explore various plotting functions on UCI data sets.
a. Normal curves
b. Density and contour plots
c. Correlation and scatter plots
d. Histograms
e. Three dimensional plotting
7. Visualizing Geographic Data with Basemap
